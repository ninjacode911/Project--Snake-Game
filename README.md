# How to Run the Snake Game on Any System
The Snake game we've created is built with standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), which means it can run on virtually any system with a web browser. Here are the different ways you can run it:

## Method 1: Direct File Opening (Simplest)
1. 1.
   Copy all the project files ( index.html , style.css , and script.js ) to a folder on the target system
2. 2.
   Double-click the index.html file to open it directly in your default web browser
3. 3.
   The game should load and be ready to play
