I'll check the current canvas styling in the CSS file and then modify it to have a brown background instead of white.

style.css 1 - 100

I'll update the CSS file to change the game container background from white to brown.

style.css

+ 3 - 2

Now I need to update the heading and score container text colors to ensure they're visible against the brown background.

style.css

+ 2 - 2

Let's open the preview to see how the brown background looks.

# Snake Game Background Updated
I've updated the Snake game's container background to brown as requested. Here's what I changed:

1. 1.
   Changed the game container background color from white to brown (#8B4513)
2. 2.
   Updated the text colors for better contrast against the brown background:
   - Changed the main text color to white for better visibility
   - Changed the score display to gold (#FFD700) to make it stand out
3. 3.
   Slightly darkened the box shadow for better definition against the new background
The game is still running on the local server at http://localhost:8000 , and you can see the changes in the preview. The brown background gives the game a more earthy, classic feel while maintaining good contrast for gameplay.

The game functionality remains unchanged - you can still control the snake with arrow keys, collect food to grow longer, and try to achieve a high score without hitting the walls or yourself.

# How to Run the Snake Game on Any System
The Snake game we've created is built with standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), which means it can run on virtually any system with a web browser. Here are the different ways you can run it:

## Method 1: Direct File Opening (Simplest)
1. 1.
   Copy all the project files ( index.html , style.css , and script.js ) to a folder on the target system
2. 2.
   Double-click the index.html file to open it directly in your default web browser
3. 3.
   The game should load and be ready to play
